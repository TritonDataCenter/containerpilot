Thanks for reporting an issue with ContainerPilot!

If you're reporting a problem, having trouble with a configuration, or think you've found a bug, please be sure to include the following information:

- what is happening and what you expect to see
- the output of `containerpilot -version`
- the ContainerPilot configuration you're using
- the output of any logs you can share; if you can it would be very helpful to turn on debug logging by adding `logging: { level: "DEBUG"}` to your ContainerPilot configuration.

If you can't provide some of this information because it's private, include what you can and we'll try to assist anyways. If you're a Joyent customer you can also reach out to Joyent's support team.
