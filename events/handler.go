// EventHandler should be embedded in all task runners so that we can
// reuse the code for registering and unregistering handlers. This is why
// the various fields are (unfortunately) public and we can't use struct
// literals for constructors. All task runner constructors will need to set
// these fields explicitly:
//
//   runner.InitRx() // makes the Rx chan
//   runner.Bus = &EventBus{}
//
// Note the Rx chan has to be buffered so as to not block Publishing of
// events, and needs enough room for all Handlers to publish their exit
// events, otherwise the calls to Receive can potentially block during
// reloads and shutdown

// that receive messages from the EventBus.

// this may be blocking in tests.
