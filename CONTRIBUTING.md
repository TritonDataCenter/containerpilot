## Contributing

ContainerPilot is open source under the [Mozilla Public License 2.0](https://github.com/joyent/containerpilot/blob/master/LICENSE).

Pull requests on GitHub are welcome on any issue. If you'd like to propose a new feature, it's often a good idea to discuss the design by opening an issue first. We'll mark these as [`proposals`](https://github.com/joyent/containerpilot/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aproposal), and roadmap items will be maintained as [`enhancements`](https://github.com/joyent/containerpilot/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aenhancement).

Many of our contributors have never contributed to an open source golang project before. If you are looking for a good first contribution, check out the [`help wanted` label](https://github.com/joyent/containerpilot/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A"help+wanted"); not that we don't want help anywhere else of course! But these are low-hanging fruit to get started.

Please make sure you've added tests for any new feature or tests that prove a bug has been fixed. Run `make lint` before submitting your PR. We test ContainerPilot on [TravisCI](https://travis-ci.org/joyent/containerpilot).
